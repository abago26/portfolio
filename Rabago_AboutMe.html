    <div class="container" align="left">
        <p align="left">My name is Andy Rabago, and I am 17 years old. I grew up knowing that I personally wanted to become a film maker,
        but also had a passion of working with computers at the same time. I have taken part in creating films for my high school's weekly video bulletin and also making
        a short film that would be entered into our school's film festival. To achieve these dreams, I plan on first going to college to achieve my Film Bachelors Degree. 
        Then if I have extra time, then I will go back to then achieve my Computer Science Bachelors Degree. I began to work with computers when I was young and began to learn code under the Windows command
        prompt. In 2015, I recieved my first laptop and decided to try coding, I erased the hard drive and loaded Ubuntu Linux onto it and began to learn how to perform 
        various commands.</p>
        
        <p>In the computer science field, I personally feel like I am a leader and also a supportive student when it comes to working with others. I believe that everyone should
        have a right to their own opinion, especially when it comes to particular aspects about a program or website. I also believe that I am creative and a knowledgeable student when
        it comes to programming computers. I have worked with Git shells in the past and recently have used the git shell on the Raspberry Pie to program a custom menu for my computer.
        Traits like these, I believe, would really help the workspace and would allow me and others to work and agree on topics for future programs.</p>

        <p>One of the major accomplishments I have achieved from Dublin High School is winning a spot to premiere my film,

        , in the 2018 Dublin High Film Festival. I currently partake in a college program at my school called AVID, this program helps me with preparing myself 
        for college by making sure I keep on top of my notes and my school work. I have also
        used the class for volunteer opportunites around the tri-valley, usually helping students in the Dublin Unified School District.</p>
        
        <p>I'd like to personally thank you for reading about me. I would very much appreciate you to freely browse this website and view the other work 
        I have done so far in my class.</p>
