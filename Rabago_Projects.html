                        Computer Science Principles</h6>
                        <p>This was the first project I was assigned in my Computer Science Principles class. I teamed up with my partner, 
                        Kaushal Ramalingam, to create a 3 level tier game using the Scratch programming interface. We brainstormed multiple ideas,
                        debating on what kind of game we should make and how it should be carried out. My parnter and I both then agreed to create a dragon game
                        where we would face a CPU that would be firing fireballs at us and we would set a value of health power to delete it. Throughout the development
                        of the game, we both equally shared comments on how the game should look, play, and feel to the user, to create a more enjoyable expierience. 
                        We had many ups and downs throughout the entire process, sometimes having to completely start over again because a certain element in the game 
                        just wouldn't function anymore and the biggest challenge we would have to face is when our code would freeze our computers. Throughout this period
                        of devolopment we also provided <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Vry9fPOPdBvJ8FfEeeHgL5Ft_j6XsqtkhVnOgGhxgzY/edit?usp=sharing">documentation</a>
                        daily as we discussesd what we managed to do for the day. We also included our brainstormed ideas, also including feedback we recieved when we finally had
                        our gallery walk. As we wrapped up the project, I learned how to work with new people and became familiar with agreeing on other people's ideas.
